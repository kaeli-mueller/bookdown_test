# Palmer Penguins
## Subtitle
### Subheading 

Today we are going to work with the **Palmer Penguins** dataset from the `palmerpenguins` 
package. Install the package as follows:

```{r install, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
#Eval = False means that it does not get run every time the document is knitted
#echo = TRUE  means it shows up but that it is not evaluated
install.packages("palmerpenguins") # add a comment
```

```{r logo, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", fig.cap = "Logo of the palmerpenguins R package", out.width = '30%'}
knitr::include_graphics("C:/Users/Kaeli/Documents/Computational_Methods/Bookdown_project/test/logo.png")

#here is how to embed an image, with the filepath after img/

#fig.cap = adds a caption to the image that youe embed
```

```{r comment, echo = FALSE}
# put my comment here
```

We are writing this in R Markdown because you can do all sorts of things in 
R Markdown, such as embedding code in text: 2 + 2 = `r 2+2`
#Shows up in your document as 2 + 2 = 4 because you but the ` around the code that you wanted to execute

```{r load, echo = TRUE, message = FALSE}
#this runs the chunk but doesn't show the weird message every time you load it
library(palmerpenguins)
library(tidyverse)
```

## The dataset

Let's take a look at the datasets available in the `palmerpenguins` package:

```{r data, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
data(package = "palmerpenguins")
```

```{r penguins, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
head(penguins)
```

### Penguin measurements
#This makes it into a bulletted list

The table `penguins` includes the following measurements:

1. Bill length;
1. Bill depth;
1. Flipper length;
1. Body mass.
#a number 1 then a . signals that this is the beginning of a numbered list
#even if you put all 1's in the list in the knitted document they will show up correctly

#### Relationship between flipper length and bill length by species

We are going to make a plot showing how flipper length and bill length vary in
different species of penguin:

```{r plot, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.align = "center", fig.cap="My plot"}
#echo = FALSE,the code is still run but it doesn't show up in the plot
#fig.align = puts the plot in the middle of the page not the side

ggplot(penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = bill_length_mm, color = species)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal() + 
  labs(x = "Flipper length (mm)", y = "Bill length (mm)", color = "Species")

```

Building our own database:
-do it through R sql lite
-eval = false for the chunks that build the database and echo = true
-all chunks should have different names, unless they are unnamed
