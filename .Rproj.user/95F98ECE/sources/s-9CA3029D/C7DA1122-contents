# Palmer Penguins

Today we are going to work with the **Palmer Penguins** dataset from the `palmerpenguins` 
package. Install the package as follows:

```{r install, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
install.packages("palmerpenguins") # add a comment
```

```{r comment, echo = FALSE}
# put my comment here
```

We are writing this in R Markdown because you can do all sorts of things in 
R Markdown, such as embedding code in text: 2 + 2 = `r 2+2`

```{r load, echo = TRUE, message = FALSE}
library(palmerpenguins)
library(tidyverse)
```

## The dataset

Let's take a look at the datasets available in the `palmerpenguins` package:

```{r data, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
data(package = "palmerpenguins")
```

```{r penguins, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
head(penguins)
```

### Penguin measurements

The table `penguins` includes the following measurements:

1. Bill length;
1. Bill depth;
1. Flipper length;
1. Body mass.

#### Relationship between flipper length and bill length by species

We are going to make a plot showing how flipper length and bill length vary in
different species of penguin:

```{r plot, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}

ggplot(penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = bill_length_mm, color = species)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal() + 
  labs(x = "Flipper length (mm)", y = "Bill length (mm)", color = "Species")

```

For more information about the `palmerpenguins` package, visit [their website](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/).

```{r logo, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", fig.cap = "Logo of the palmerpenguins R package", out.width = '30%'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/logo.png")
```
